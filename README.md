# Space-Invaders
A version of space invaders written in java, using my own [grid based game engine](https://github.com/hii488/Gridbased-Engine/tree/master).

Run from the command line with -ai in order to use a GA-NN algorithm to play instead of you yourself playing. (uses [this](https://github.com/hii488/AI-Base-GANN))
